Difficulties encountered in efforts to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate this search for someone to assist me. My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money. To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our properties.The money has since been deposited with a private finance andsecurity firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to you. All other information",1,1

I want a church tha t will use this fund on,orphanages, deaf and dumb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.
